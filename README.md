# Rust mini project -- Caesar Encryption and Decryption 
This is a simple Caesar password encryption and decryption program written in Rust. The entire program first receives the text and key input from the user, then encrypts the text with the Caesar cipher and outputs the encrypted text. Next, the program decrypts the encrypted text and outputs the decrypted text.
